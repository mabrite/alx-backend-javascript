Introduction
The 0x06-unittests_in_js project focuses on the fundamentals of writing unit tests in JavaScript. This project aims to help you understand how to create and run unit tests using popular testing frameworks such as Mocha and Chai. Unit testing is essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your code.

Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files and folders:

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (Node package manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x06-unittests_in_js.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd 0x06-unittests_in_js
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
To run the application or use any utility functions, you can require them in your Node.js scripts from the src directory. For example:

javascript
Copy code
const { add, subtract } = require('./src/math');

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
Testing
To run the tests, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will run all tests defined in the test directory using Mocha and Chai.

Example Test
Here is an example of what a test file might look like in test/math.test.js:

javascript
Copy code
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { add, subtract } = require('../src/math');

describe('Math Functions', () => {
  describe('add()', () => {
    it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
      expect(add(2, 3)).to.equal(5);
    });
  });

  describe('subtract()', () => {
    it('should return the difference of two numbers', () => {
      expect(subtract(5, 2)).to.equal(3);
    });
  });
});
